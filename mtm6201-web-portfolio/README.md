Among the many subject materials, I finally chose to promote the brand. My website introduced Apple and its products.  In the process of my development, many times, I do n’t know what I should write. After the idea, I design the layout, design content, pictures, fonts.  In many cases, it is necessary to consider whether the size of the picture or font is appropriate, and whether the position is beautiful.  When I have no idea, I will look for inspiration on Apple's official website.  Through this practice, I understand the idea of ​​designing webpages to be empty, dare to innovate, and dare to try and error.  And be careful.  When these are all done, you can definitely make satisfactory works.

In this web,I used css,js and fonts  were from bootstrap,some images were from Internet.
